# Testing Payme Payment Integration

## Overview of Changes Made
1. Completed the PaymeController implementation:
   - Added missing transaction handling methods (createTransaction, performTransaction, checkTransaction, cancelTransaction)
   - Implemented success, failed, and canceled methods to handle payment callbacks
   - Fixed amount comparison in checkPerformTransaction method

2. Completed the PaymeMerchantController implementation:
   - Implemented the handle method to properly forward requests to PaymeController

3. Added missing routes for the Payme payment flow:
   - Added success, failed, and canceled routes to handle payment callbacks

## How to Test the Changes

### Test 1: Complete Payment Flow
1. Select Payme as the payment method during checkout
2. Complete the payment process on the Payme payment page
3. Verify that you are redirected back to the success page
4. Check the database to confirm that:
   - The payment record is marked as paid (is_paid = 1)
   - An order has been created for the payment

### Test 2: Merchant API Callback
1. Use a tool like Postman to simulate a callback from Payme:
   - Send a POST request to `/payment/payme-merchant`
   - Include the appropriate authentication headers
   - Include a request body with method "CreateTransaction" and appropriate parameters
   - Verify that the response is successful
2. Send another POST request with method "PerformTransaction"
   - Verify that the payment is marked as paid
   - Verify that an order is created

### Test 3: Failed Payment
1. Select Payme as the payment method during checkout
2. Cancel the payment on the Payme payment page
3. Verify that you are redirected back to the failed or canceled page
4. Check the database to confirm that:
   - The payment record is not marked as paid (is_paid = 0)
   - No order has been created for the payment

## Troubleshooting
If orders are still not being created, check the following:

1. Verify that the success_hook function is properly defined and registered for the payment
2. Check the logs for any errors during the payment process
3. Ensure that the Payme configuration (merchant ID, keys, etc.) is correct
4. Verify that the payment amount is correctly formatted and matches between the order and the payment request

## Notes
- The Payme integration now follows the same pattern as other payment methods in the system
- The key to order creation is the call to the success_hook function, which is called when a payment is marked as successful
- Both the PaymeController and PaymeMerchantController now properly handle the payment flow and update the payment record
