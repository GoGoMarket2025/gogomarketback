# Payme Payment Controller Optimization

## Problem
The PaymeController's payment function was experiencing long execution times, resulting in 504 Gateway Timeout errors. The function was performing multiple resource-intensive operations in a single request:

1. Validating payment data
2. Retrieving cart information through multiple database queries
3. Creating orders for each cart group (which itself involves multiple database operations)
4. Storing data in the session
5. Generating the payment URL and redirecting

## Solution
The solution implements a deferred order creation approach:

1. **Lightweight Payment Initialization**: The payment function now only performs essential operations before redirecting to the payment gateway:
   - Validates the payment ID
   - Retrieves basic payment data
   - Stores minimal order information in the session
   - Generates the payment URL and redirects

2. **Deferred Order Creation**: The resource-intensive order creation process is deferred until after the user returns from the payment gateway:
   - Orders are created in the success callback when payment is confirmed
   - Failed and canceled callbacks clear any pending order data
   - This approach significantly reduces the execution time of the payment function

3. **Optimized Database Queries**: The cart group ID retrieval logic has been improved:
   - More efficient query approach with fewer conditions
   - Better error handling with proper logging

## Changes Made

### 1. PaymeController::payment()
- Removed immediate order creation process
- Now stores minimal required data in the session
- Performs only essential operations before redirecting

### 2. PaymeController::success()
- Added logic to check for pending order data in the session
- Created a new private method `createDeferredOrders` to handle the order creation process
- Improved the cart group ID retrieval logic
- Added error handling with try/catch and logging

### 3. PaymeController::failed() and PaymeController::canceled()
- Added logic to check for and clear any pending order data in the session
- Maintained existing logic for handling orders that were already created

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Payment Flow
1. Add items to your cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Select Payme as the payment method
4. Click "Proceed to Payment"
5. Verify that you are redirected to the Payme payment page quickly (without timeout)
6. Complete the payment
7. Verify that you are redirected back to the success page
8. Check that orders are created correctly in the admin panel

### Test 2: Large Cart Test
1. Add multiple items to your cart (10+ items if possible)
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Select Payme as the payment method
4. Click "Proceed to Payment"
5. Verify that you are redirected to the Payme payment page quickly (without timeout)
6. Complete the payment
7. Verify that orders are created correctly

### Test 3: Failed Payment Test
1. Add items to your cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Select Payme as the payment method
4. Click "Proceed to Payment"
5. Cancel the payment on the Payme payment page
6. Verify that you are redirected back to the failed or canceled page
7. Verify that no orders are created

## Performance Comparison
The optimization should result in:
- Significantly faster redirection to the payment gateway
- No more 504 Gateway Timeout errors
- Proper order creation after successful payment
- Consistent handling of failed or canceled payments

## Maintenance Notes
- The deferred order creation approach maintains backward compatibility with the existing order handling logic
- Error handling has been improved with proper logging
- The solution follows the same pattern as other payment methods in the system
